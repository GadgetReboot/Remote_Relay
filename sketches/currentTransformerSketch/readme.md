The calibration constant for the current transformer in the sketch is explained here:<br>

<br><br>
For a current transformer that gives an output voltage of 1V at a certain max current, the calibration number should be current transformer max current divided by 
the voltage output at max current.
<br><br>I'm using a 5A current transformer that provides 1V out at 5A, so my calibration constant should be <br>
5A / 1V = 5
<br>
and I ended up tweaking it to 4.92 to get the results that seemed to work best.
